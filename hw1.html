		<p>
			Hello Kitty, also known by her real name <mark>Kitty White</mark>,
			is a fictional character created by Yuko Shimizu, currently designed
			by Yuko Yamaguchi, and owned by the Japanese company Sanrio. Sanrio
			depicts Hello Kitty as an anthropomorphized white cat with a red bow
			and no visible mouth. According to her backstory, she lives in a
			London suburb with her family, and is close to her twin sister
			Mimmy, who is depicted with a yellow bow. Hello Kitty was created in
			1974 and the first item,
			<span style="color: blue">a vinyl coin purse</span>, was introduced
			in 1975. Originally Hello Kitty was only marketed towards
			pre-teenage girls, but beginning in the 1990s, the brand found
			commercial success among teenage and adult consumers as well.
